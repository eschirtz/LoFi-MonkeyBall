# LoFi-MonkeyBall
#### [Eric Schirtzinger](https://github.com/eschirtz) & [Carly Krebs](https://github.com/krebcarl)

Taking inspiration from the classic video game series "Monkey Ball", we wrote this game for the [Tiva Launch Pad (ARM Cortex-M)](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Tiva_C_Series_LaunchPads).

>This application was written as part of an open ended final project for ECE353 Introduction to Microprocessor Systems, taught by Eric Hoffman at University of Wisconsin Madison in 2018.

```C
int main()
{
    char a = 30;
    char b = 40;
    char c = 10;
    char d = (a * b) / c;
    printf ("%d ", d);
 
    return 0;
}
```
